        <p className='mb-4'>on august 4th 2015, i was leaving my hometown Surabaya, Indonesia with a one-way ticket to San Francisco, California. after graduated high school, i decided to study at <a>Diablo Valley College</a> in Pleasant Hill, California.</p>
        <p className='mb-4'>i was planning to study mechanical engineering initially, but things changed after i took my first computer science class. i liked cs better than physics/chemistry because i thought it was "easier". i thought to myself "hmm i struggled a lot and got a B on my first physics class, whereas i aced my first computer science class with very little prior programming knowledge, maybe i should change major and start coding. i think cs is much easier."</p>
        <p className='mb-4'>boy oh boy was i wrong, coding <strong><u>is not</u></strong> easy (don't get me wrong, i enjoy every struggle that i had learning to code tho :D)</p>

        <h1 className='underline mb-10'>transfer to uni</h1>
        <p className='mb-4'>fast forward to 2017, i transferred from college to <a>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> majoring in computer science & statistics as a junior. did i say cs @ college was hard? lol it's even harder in uni because 1) uni is generally tougher than community college (just harder and more workload) and 2) UIUC is one of the best computer science school, notable alumni includes <a>Marc Andreessen</a>. <a>Max Levchin (co-founder of Paypal)</a>, and <a>Thomas Siebel (founder of C3.ai)</a>.</p>
        <p className='mb-4'>at this point, i'm in a love & hate relationship with coding. it's hard, but it challenges you to think creatively.</p>

        <p className='mb-4'>i finished my master's degree from UIUC with a GPA of 3.90. imo, master's degree is <strong><u>way easier</u></strong> than bachelor's, probably because of the major too. however, while studying data science and working as a software engineer, i feel that i like being a software engineer rather than a data scientist. however, there's 1 very important lesson that i learn this year is that <strong><u>nobody knows anything</u></strong>, like for real. growing up, i have this beliefs where most working adults know their stuffs. turns out they are also figuring things out, but with more experience.</p>

        <h1 className='underline mb-10'>moving on...</h1>
        <p className='mb-4'>Dialisa has been slowing down for the past year. it's very hard to break into a healthcare industry, an industry with a very tight regulation and a lot of gate-keepers. one of the reason i go back to Indonesia is because we think maybe we can sell better in Indonesia. however, that's not the case. it was a hard decision, but i decided to move on.</p>
        <p className='mb-4'>i decided that i want to join a company who is working in web3 (because it's the fUtURe). crypto has been moving downward since the beginning of the 2022, but i always thought bear market was a good time to build. i joined <a href="https://www.inflectionpoints.co/">Inflection Points</a> as a founding frontend engineer, a startup based in Miami, Florida who works in training common people and professionals to learn more about web3 as an industry.</p>
